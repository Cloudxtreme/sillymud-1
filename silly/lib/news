look at the mortal board at the altar of the Temple of Midgaard.

CHANGES FROM THE ORIGINAL SillyMUD

A few changes from the original SillyMUD source code were necessary to get
the old codebase working properly:

1) Rent was previously set to 0 cost but still charged, based on time,
   during the login (when using the NEW_RENT define).  Rent was made free
   (upon a "quit" command or disconnect) to be easier for users
   (when using the NO_RENT define).
2) The starting room (The Temple of Midgaard) wasn't marked as peaceful after
   your initial arrival (so mobs could come to kill you inside the temple).
   The room is now always peaceful, so it is ok to flee there
   (instead of the reception room).
3) The "donate" command was enabled after being previously disabled due to
   the creation of long linked-lists.
4) Druids are allowed to go to their hometown of Mordilnia without reaching
   level 5 by the Welcome menu option #5.
5) The destination for New Thalos via the Welcome menu option #5 was fixed
   (it previously dropped users into a room with no exits).
6) Link-dead users are removed from the room they became link-dead in.
7) The signal.h usage needed to be updated to using sigaction and sigsetops.
8) The client port is stored in the descriptor data for connection tracking.
9) Telnet echo-on/echo-off sequences were disabled to avoid display issues
   in HTML.
